# SM Ticket - Flutter <img alt="PyPI - Python Version" src="https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/Django"> <img alt="Dichill" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/SM-Tickets-blue">

**DISCLAIMER** SMTickets-Flutter is a continuation of a backend that I made named DrX - SM Tickets API (Can be found in my Repositories.) This is a project that aims to help me learn Request thru API between the client and the server. This is a learning process since I'm not that familiar with Flutter, but with tons of research I managed to make it.
